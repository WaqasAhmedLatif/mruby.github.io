# mruby 3.0.0

We are announcing the first stable release of mruby 3.0 series - [mruby 3.0.0](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/releases/tag/3.0.0).

With mruby 3.0, the memory used of the mruby VM has been significantly reduced, and we have succeeded in significantly saving memory.
Previous versions required several hundred KB of RAM, but mruby 3.0 can launch an application with about 100 KB of RAM.

Describes the new features and changes in mruby 3.0.  
The main changes in mruby 3.0 are also described in [doc/mruby3.md](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/blob/master/doc/mruby3.md).

# Update Features

## Reduce memory usage

- Preallocate Symbols  
  The mruby 3.0 can now significantly reduce RAM usage by allocating symbols to static memory area at compile time. See [doc/guides/symbol.md](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/blob/master/doc/guides/symbol.md) for more information.
- Reduce memory usage of Hash objects. [f2d8db39](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/commit/f2d8db39)
- Reduce memory usage when calling methods. [#5272](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/pull/5272)

## Updated build process

The old build configuration file `build_config.rb` has been reconfigured to a file in the `build_config` directory.  
For example, the following typical build configuration is available.

- `default`: the default configuration
- `host-gprof`: compiles with `gprof` for performance tuning
- `host-m32`: compiles in gcc 32bit mode on 64bit platforms
- `boxing`: compiles all three boxing options
- `clang-asan`: compiles with clang's Address Sanitizer

You can specify the mruby build configuration by building mruby with the `rake` build, specifying the build configuration file in the environment variable `MRUBY_CONFIG`.

## Core Libraries

- Add new libraries.
  - `mruby-catch` - Support `Kernel.#catch` and `Kernel.#throw`. [7eaaee54](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/commit/7eaaee54)
  - `mruby-os-memsize` - Support `ObjectSpace.memsize_of` and `ObjectSpace.memsize_of_all`. [#5032](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/pull/5032) [#5040](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/pull/5040) [#5041](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/pull/5041)
- Add `Array.new([])` initialization. (mruby-array)
- Add `Hash#except` (mruby-hash-ext)
- Update `IO#popen` to use keyword arguments. (mruby-io)
- Make `Module#include` and `Module#prepend` behave like Ruby 3.0. [3972df57](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/commit/3972df57)

## Tools

- Allow to mixed and specify `*.rb` and `*.mrb` in `mruby` interpreter. [a045b6b8](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/commit/a045b6b8)
- Add `irep` C struct dump from `mrbc` with `-S` option.

## Features for mruby Developer

- Add new specifier `c` to `mrb_get_args()` for receive Class/Module.

# Breaking Changes

## mruby VM and bytecode

Due to improvements in the binary format, mruby binaries are no longer backward compatible. 
To run the mruby binaries on mruby 3.0, recompile with the mruby 3.0 `mrbc`.

- Upgrade mruby VM version `RITE_VM_VER` to `0300` (means mruby 3.0).
- Upgrade mruby binary version `RITE_BINARY_FORMAT_VER` to `0200`.

## Recognize Integer system

`Integer` has been changed to a specification similar to CRuby.

- Integrate `Fixnum` and `Integer`.
- Remove `Integral`.
- `int / int -> int`
- Add APIs for `Integer`.  APIs for `Fixnum` (`mrb_fixnum_xxx()`) is also left for compatibility.
  - `mrb_fixnum()` -> `mrb_integer()`
  - `mrb_fixnum_value()` -> `mrb_int_value()`
  - `mrb_fixnum_p()` -> `mrb_integer_p()`
